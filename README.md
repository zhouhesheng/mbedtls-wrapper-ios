# mbed TLS Wrapper for iOS

1. If build fails and shows "tar: Error exit delayed from previous errors.", delete `mbedTLS/mbedtls-2.12.0-gpl.tgz` (or whole `mbedTLS` folder) and try again. 
2. If build fails with any other reason - delete contents of `mbedTLS` folder (you can leave `mbedtls-2.12.0-gpl.tgz`, but you need to delete all subfolders) and try again.
